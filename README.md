## overview

This Java program manages attendance and grades for students across multiple subjects. It calculates whether a student passes or fails based on attendance and grade criteria. Additionally, it incorporates an option for an excuse of absence, affecting the attendance record.

## learning-objectives

1.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Practice creating classes and objects to model real-world entities.

2.Conditional Statements: Learn how to use conditional statements to make decisions based on specified criteria.

3.User Input Handling: Utilize the Scanner class to handle user input for attendance, grades, and excuses of absence.

4.Looping Constructs: Implement loops to allow repeated operations until a termination condition is met.

5.Algorithmic Thinking: Develop an algorithm to calculate average attendance and determine student success or failure.

6.Documentation and Sharing: Document code with comments and create a README.md file to provide instructions and project overview.


## setup-and-tutorial

### 1. Setup

#### 1.1 Java Development Kit (JDK)

Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install JDK from the official Oracle website: [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

#### 1.2 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development. Some popular options include:
- [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Download and install the IDE of your choice.

### 2. Tutorial

#### 2.1 Java Basics

If you're new to Java programming, it's essential to understand the basics of the language. Key topics to cover include:
- Syntax: variables, data types, operators, etc.
- Input/output using `System.out.println` and `Scanner` class.
- Control flow statements: if-else, switch-case, loops.

#### 2.2 Attendance with Grade System Algorithm

Before coding, plan the algorithm for managing attendance and grades:
- Prompt the user to input attendance for each subject and an excuse of absence if applicable.
- Calculate average attendance across subjects.
- Prompt the user to input grades for the semester.
- Determine whether the student passes or fails based on attendance and grade criteria.

#### 2.3 Coding the Attendance with Grade System

Start coding the Attendance with Grade System project:
- Create a Student class to represent student information, including attendance, grades, and methods for calculating success or failure.
- Implement the main application logic to handle user interactions, input, and output.
- Utilize conditional statements and looping constructs to manage attendance, grades, and determining student success or failure.
- Test the program with various inputs to ensure correctness and handle edge cases.


#### 2.4 Documentation and Sharing

Document your code with comments to explain functionality and logic. Create a README.md file to provide project instructions and overview. Share your project with the programming club for feedback and collaboration.


## Project Overview:

### Description

This Java project focuses on creating an Attendance with Grade System program to manage student attendance and grades for multiple subjects. The program allows users to input attendance, grades, and excuses of absence, and determines whether students pass or fail based on specified criteria.

### Requirements

1. **Attendance Tracking:**
   - Track attendance for each subject (math, physics, chemistry, programming) with specified requirements.
   - Allow users to input an excuse of absence, increasing absences if the excuse contains the word "hospital".

2. **Grade Input:**
   - Prompt users to input grades for the semester (out of 5).

3. **Success/Failure Determination:**
   - Calculate average attendance across subjects and determine if it meets the minimum requirement.
   - Determine if the grade is above 3.5 to determine student success or failure.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Implement a user-friendly interface to input attendance, grades, and excuses of absence.
   - Provide clear output indicating whether the student passes or fails.

### Example Interaction
```Welcome to the Attendance and Grade System!
Enter student name: John Doe
Mark attendance for each subject (Enter 'hospital' for excuse of absence):
Math: 
Physics: hospital
Chemistry: 
Programming: 
Enter grade for the semester (out of 5): 4.2

Student Information:
Name: John Doe
Math Attendance: 45 days
Physics Attendance: 42 days
Chemistry Attendance: 40 days
Programming Attendance: 46 days
Grade: 4.2

Result: Success
```

### Bonus

- Implement file I/O to read student information from a file and store results.
- Enhance the user interface with ASCII art or additional messages for better engagement.
